# Hand Gesture volume control

This project aims to create a system for controlling the volume of a device using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can track hand movements in real-time and interpret specific gestures to adjust the volume accordingly. The system provides a hands-free and intuitive way to control audio volume, making it convenient for users in various scenarios, such as while cooking, exercising, or working at a desk.

## Features

- Hand Detection : The project includes algorithms for detecting and tracking the position of a user's hand in a video stream or webcam feed.
- Gesture Recognition : Using machine learning models, the system recognizes predefined hand gestures that correspond to volume control commands, such as increase volume, decrease volume, and mute.
- Real-time Feedback : The volume adjustments are applied in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user as they perform the gestures.
- Adaptability : The system is adaptable to different environments and lighting conditions, making it suitable for use in various settings.

## Requirements

- Python
- Mediapipe
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- Pycaw (audio Library)

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the main script ```app.py``` to start the volume control system.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the system and perform hand gestures for volume control.
- Enjoy hands-free volume adjustment while listening to audio or video content on your device.
